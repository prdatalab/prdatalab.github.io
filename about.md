The Puerto Rico Data Lab uses a variety of datasets, data mining methodologies and data visualization tools to explore Puerto Rico’s current challenges and future opportunities. Ultimately, the Puerto Rico Data Lab hopes to raise questions and encourage critical dialogue about:

1. Puerto Rico’s post-Hurricane Maria recovery efforts.
2. The causes and consequences of the island’s debt crisis.
3. Puerto Rico’s political dynamics and its evolving relationship with the U.S. federal government.

The Puerto Rico Data Lab was established by [Carlos L. Yordán](cyordan.name). Professor Yordán was born and raised in Puerto Rico, has a PhD from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and is Associate Professor in International Relations at Drew University, where he directs the Semester on the United Nations.
